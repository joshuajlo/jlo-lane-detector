# JLo Lane Detector

## Overview

I developed a simple lane detection system called JLo Lane Detector to detect and visualize lanes on the road in videos. It utilizes computer vision techniques to identify and highlight lane lines, making it a valuable tool for various applications, such as autonomous vehicles or driver assistance systems. This was developed to expand my knowledge on OpenCV and to dive into the basics of autnomous driving .


## Features

- Lane detection in video streams.
- Visualization of detected lanes on the original video frames.
- Filtering out non-lane lines to improve accuracy.

## Installation

1. Clone the project repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/joshuajlo/jlo-lane-detector.git
   cd jlo-lane-detector
   
2. Install the required dependencies.
  pip install numpy
  pip install opencv-python
  pip install moviepy
